&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025108.do?code=WKCPRGM"&gt;21st Century C&lt;/a&gt;. I have a good history with O'Reilly and C programming, so
it caught my attention. When I was in University, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565923065.do?code=WKCPRGM"&gt;Practical C Programming&lt;/a&gt;
taught me much more than any of my professors, and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565921634.do"&gt;Unix System Programming for System VR4&lt;/a&gt; taught me a great deal more about
programming C on Unix/Linux. After reading those books, I became actually
comfortable in working in C for all of my assignments, and other students
kept coming to me for help until I had somehow become a local C expert.
Amazing what a good investment in reading material will do, not to mention
actually reading said material. Another friend in University taught me that.
He told me not to ever begrudge the cost of a book that helps you get better
at what you do. I've applied that lesson ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I relied on O'Reilly for my first introduction to C++, with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565921160.do"&gt;C++, the Core Language&lt;/a&gt;, which finally explained to me where some of my
memory leaks were coming from, by explaining copy constructors and assignment
operators. I turned to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Beginning_C++.html?id=vtcpAQAAMAAJ"&gt;another book&lt;/a&gt; to finish most of my C++ education, but
o'Reilly got me started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since University, with the wealth of information on the Internet, I haven't
bought many C books, but I did pick up &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://basepath.com/aup/"&gt;Advanced Unix Programming&lt;/a&gt;, second
edition, on the recommendation of a coworker, and he did not lead me astray,
the book is excellent. Mind you, I still haven't finished reading it. I seem
to buy books faster than I read them these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one day I'll take a little vacation just to read. Anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the new O'Reilly book, it looks like it has many practical ideas
for someone living with C from day to day, and should also provide a nice
introduction to the new C11 standard, just released in December of last year.
Hopefully it'll sharpen my skills like previous O'Reilly books have. I'll try
to post a full review once I've finished it...err...if I finish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will stop buying faster than I can read. I will stop buying faster than I
can read. Maybe if I keep repeating that, it'll sink in.&lt;/p&gt;
