found anything in the world to make me feel more helpless than my own child
telling me that they feel bad, and knowing that I can't fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

about life. I thought I'd share some of what it has taught me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balance is very important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anything worthwhile requires hard work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you often can't brute force your way out of a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you must …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Michael P.

From my childhood I always prefered more intellectual
activities than active ones, reading, watching movies, tv. Growing up
asthmatic had something to do with that, but I overcame it later in life and
had no excuses anymore. Still, studies to do, computers to play with, digital …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Michael P.

various games. I've probably played most of them. Roleplaying games, tabletop
battle simulations, although I stayed away from the card games like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Summoner/"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;.
I'll rant about that some other time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two favorite games were &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/474579/air-superiority-playable-jet-combat"&gt;Air …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Michael P.

over. I was thinking of building my own static blogging system, but I looked
around and found that there are a few already. Being a fan of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; I
decided to try out &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.0/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.
