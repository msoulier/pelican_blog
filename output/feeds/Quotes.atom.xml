&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.jim-butcher.com/books/dresden"&gt;Dresden Files&lt;/a&gt;, and I felt the need to share this quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, ladies, if you ever have some conversation with your boyfriend or
husband or brother or male friend, and you are telling him something
perfectly obvious, and he comes away from it utterly clueless? I know it's
tempting to think to yourself, &amp;quot;The man can't possibly be that stupid!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yes. Yes, he can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our innate strengths just aren't the same. We are the mighty hunters, who
are good at focusing on one thing at a time. For crying out loud, we have
to turn down the radio in the car if we suspect we're lost and need to
figure out how to get where we're going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umm, yeah, I've had to turn the radio down...&lt;/p&gt;
