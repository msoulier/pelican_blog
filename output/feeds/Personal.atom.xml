about life. I thought I'd share some of what it has taught me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balance is very important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anything worthwhile requires hard work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you often can't brute force your way out of a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you must think before you act&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you can often do much more with help from others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shouting at people doesn't actually make them work harder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hope for the best and plan for the worst&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when you finally understand the conditions, they change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don't take anything too seriously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and finally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;men can still look like men while holding a broom :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;

Soulier</name></author><id>tag:www.but-i-digress.ca,2012-11-08:i-sit-too-much.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I really do. From my childhood I always prefered more intellectual
activities than active ones, reading, watching movies, tv. Growing up
asthmatic had something to do with that, but I overcame it later in life and
had no excuses anymore. Still, studies to do, computers to play with, digital
bad guys to beat up, and a lot of my activities involved sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played baseball as a kid, got into Tae kwon Do in my late teens, but as a
University student I couldn't afford the money to continue, and I moved a lot
for a while. I was never much of a runner, but for a while I was a damn good
cyclist because I didn't have a car and it was how I got around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years a back injury made it clear that I sit too much, and I've
tried various things to try to fix it, usually charging in too fast,
determined to conquer the problem and I ended up with another injury. I needed
to figure out how to go slower, targeting my problems and not doing too much,
but making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently the wife that I don't deserve found &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.athlete365.com/"&gt;Athlete365&lt;/a&gt; and Mr. John
Sokolowski. He looked at my flexibility and strength, or lack thereof, and has
put together an evolving program to help me fix them, at a speed that won't
set me back with another injury. He also gave me some tools to help with
muscles that keep me awake at night, ruining my sleep. He also thinks that I
should become a Yoga master. Heh...sure John. Maybe in 20 years of practice.
I'm right on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been tweaking my diet, not that my diet was bad, but I recently
found out about some of the evils of excessive carbohydrates, from an amusing
documentary, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.fathead-movie.com/"&gt;Fat Head&lt;/a&gt;, a response to &amp;quot;Supersize Me&amp;quot;. Since reducing
bread (not hard, I have a gluten tolerance issue), rice and potatoes in my
diet, and exercising more, I've lost about ten pounds in the past couple of
months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My issues aren't gone by any means, I have a lot of work to do, but guidance
helps. There's a difference between working hard and working smart.
Previously, I was just working hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've read this sitting down, get up and move around. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;

Soulier</name></author><id>tag:www.but-i-digress.ca,2012-11-04:dusting-off-old-games.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back before I had any real responsibilities, I spent a lot of time playing
various games. I've probably played most of them. Roleplaying games, tabletop
battle simulations, although I stayed away from the card games like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Summoner/"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;.
I'll rant about that some other time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two favorite games were &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/474579/air-superiority-playable-jet-combat"&gt;Air Superiority&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.starfleetgames.com"&gt;Starfleet Battles&lt;/a&gt;. As a
science fiction fan, I did like Star Trek, and like a lot of boys my favorite
parts were the ship to ship combat. SFB simulated that combat better than I'd
ever seen before, and even spun off a pretty cool &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwQ3rm0LcWU"&gt;video game&lt;/a&gt; that spawned a
couple of sequels. I still have the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="http://www.but-i-digress.ca/static/images/sfb.png" src="http://www.but-i-digress.ca/static/images/sfb.png" style="width: 800px; height: 478px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tabletop game was as complex as any chess game, and a lot more fun in my
opinion, so it was with no small amount of nostalgia that I dusted off the
game for my 10-year-old son and I to look at a couple of months ago. To my
surprise, Jaan ate the game up, even if the rules sound like legalese and
combined weigh a few pounds. Now he can't get enough of the game, and I get to
play too, which is pretty cool, 'cause I don't have a lot of time for these
things anymore and I wasn't sure if anyone around Ottawa played it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not really interested in all of the new material that ADB has released
since I was into the game, as I have plenty of material for it already, and
it'll take Jaan and I ages to get tired of it. The physics of the game are
broken and there are holes in the logic that I'll go into later, but it
suceeds in providing a fun gaming experience, and it's a hell of a lot more
fun than playing Monopoly or Clue, with all due respect to those games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets be honest, in the end, boys don't grow up, our toys just get more
expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

Soulier</name></author><id>tag:www.but-i-digress.ca,2012-11-03:new-static-blog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I decided to dump Wordpress and go to something that I have more control
over. I was thinking of building my own static blogging system, but I looked
around and found that there are a few already. Being a fan of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; I
decided to try out &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.0/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;. It uses a bunch of technology that I would use
anyway, like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html"&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/"&gt;Jinja2&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also gives me an excuse to play with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://heroku.com/"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; for hosting. Which, I must
say, is pretty cool for getting a website or web service hosted quickly, with
nothing but a push from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; to trigger the publishing of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, Heroku was meant to host dynamic sites driven by WSGI apps, but I
found a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kennethreitz.com/static-sites-on-heroku-cedar.html"&gt;great hack&lt;/a&gt; to fool Heroku
into running a static site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we'll see how this goes. My main blogging tools now are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vim.org/"&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, so
how can I go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
