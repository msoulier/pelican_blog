Honda Canada, complaining about Kanata Honda and their ridiculous justification
for the key cylinders in my car to wear out so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Honda Canada did, in fact, get back to me. A nice lady from the office
of the President of Honda Canada called me and informed me that since these
issues happened so quickly as my car was coming off of its warranty, that they
were willing to help with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We played phone tag for a while, until I got in touch with her and she told me
that she was going to follow up with the dealership, and I should hear from
her in 2 days. A month went by and I had heard nothing, so I started calling.
I called on several occasions, days apart, leaving voicemail after voicemail,
none of which were returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to assume that I'd been given nothing but lip service, and there would
be no actual action. In frustration, I complainted to &amp;#64;HondaCanada on twitter,
and they did get back to me, resulting in my getting a phonecall from the
nice woman within 24 hours. At this point I'm assuming that she is just
ridiculously busy, and I wasn't important enough, not that she actually
intended to lead me on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally connected by phone, with this understanding. Honda would replace
the passenger door key cylinder which was seizing up, just like the trunk.
The key cylinder on the trunk that I had already replaced, they would re-key
so that I could go back to having a single key again. They would not cover
the cost of any replacements keys if my keys wore out. This was the extent of
what they planned to do to help me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, decided that I'd fought on the issue enough, and that they were
being reasonable, considering that the key cylinders and keys were off
warranty. Not that it's ok for them to fail at all, mind you, but it is what
it is. I knew the warranty when I bought the car. That's on me. Next time
maybe I go with a car company with a better warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, they followed through. I worked with the service manager at
Kanata Honda, got my appointment, and as of now, the work is done. There will
likely be additional problems with the key cylinders and keys, and this time
I'll be on my own, but at least I've gotten a little help from them on an
issue that is obviously a manufacturing defect or design flaw. Keys and key
cylinders shouldn't fail people. I don't care of most people use keyless
entry, I'm not doing so and I expect these systems to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this good customer service? Well, in the end, ok, but throughout the issue,
no, not really. I should not have had to work this hard to make this happen.
The issue is obviously Honda's responsibility, so suck it up, take
responsibility like an adult, and make your customers happy. Don't wait until
they're frustrated out of their minds and irate on a telephone, or blogging
for the world to see about your crappy service before you're embarrassed
enough to do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

Soulier</name></author><id>tag:www.but-i-digress.ca,2015-08-20:a-letter-to-honda-canada.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently had reason to write to the CEO of Honda Canada, Mr. Jerry Chenkin,
to outline why I am less than pleased with my 2010 Honda Fit, and ensure
that he, or whomever ends up reading this, has the full story of what our
experience with his company has been like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my letter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Chenkin,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, we decided as a family to replace our aging family car, a 1999
Saturn SL1. In my research I found my way to Honda for your reputation for
reliability, even though pound for pound, Hondas are more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our needs as a family of four are modest, and gasoline is expensive,
so the Fit caught our attention. We decided on a base model with no
options. It became our new family car. Our only car, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until late 2013, we really had no problems with the vehicle. It worked
as advertised. It was reliable, flexible, cheap to operate and easy to
drive. We put on a roof rack and camped with it. We brought home wood
with it, even a washing machine. I loved this little car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in late 2013, my key began sticking in the rear hatch lock. I
lubricated all of the locks but it only helped for moments at a time. I
took the car into Kanata Honda, where I'd bought it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, they said my keys were worn, and they cut a new key to prove
it to me, but this new key failed to continue working on the trunk for more
than my visit, after any lubrication had a chance to wear off. I followed
up by phone and was told that the lock would require replacing, in a barely
3-year-old car whose OEM tires hadn't worn-out yet. They tried to tell me
that this kind of wear is normal, especially with the salt on Ottawa roads.
By that logic, Kanata Honda should not be selling Honda vehicles, since
they are obviously not suitable for Ottawa's roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I didn't feel like paying for work that should not be required, I paid
a ludicrous $70 to Kanata Honda for a replacement cylinder and did the
work myself. Now I have two keys, as I did not sync up the tumblers to
the other cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the problem had ended there, I might count myself lucky. Plenty of
people have automotive horror stories. Car quality simply is not very
good. But, it did not stop there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, I noticed the key sticking in the ignition and the driver-side
door. I lubricated them heavily and the problem ceased. Now, the
passenger door key sticks so badly that my wife can barely get her key
back. After talking to Kanata Honda and having their foreman try to feed
me some tripe about it being normal it is clear that I will find no
real help there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending over 20 minutes waiting in the Honda Canada customer
support phone queue, the woman I spoke with was less than sympathetic.
The passenger lock is being replaced Friday at Kanata Honda, at my expense.
I haven't a clue if Honda Canada will reimburse me for parts that are
so obviously defective, but for obvious reasons, I am not hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's next? The trunk again? The driver door? The ignition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don't care if it's off warranty. Burning through key cylinders
faster than brake pads is &lt;em&gt;ridiculous&lt;/em&gt;. They are &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; defective,
and if Honda cannot get key cylinders right, how can they be trusted with
any other part of the car?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son is about to turn 13. He'll be driving in a few years and I'll be
looking for something sportier for myself. At the moment, my next car
will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be a Honda. However, the true test of a person or a company in
my mind is not whether they make mistakes. It is whether they take
responsibility for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would enjoy having faith in a car company for a change. At the moment,
it feels like Honda Canada and Kanata Honda stopped caring after they had
my money. The only control that I have is ensuring that you don't get
another cent from me, even if the next car company is just as bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would enjoy hearing your thoughts on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,
Michael Soulier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mailed this letter today. What do you think the chances are that I'll get a
response at all, let alone a fair and favourable one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to rely on the techs at Kanata Honda, but when they tell me that
this is normal, I smell bullshit. There is no way this is normal. I just
want them to admit that. Maybe then they lose money on this repair, but I
keep coming back for more service, and possibly a future car. But I suppose
they don't really care if they lose all of my future business. If they did,
would they try to feed me such utter nonsense, and wipe their hands of
the matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good customer service, that is not. They didn't make the car, but they were
happy to sell it to me.&lt;/p&gt;
