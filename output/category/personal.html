</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Back before I had any real responsibilities, I spent a lot of time playing
various games. I've probably played most of them. Roleplaying games, tabletop
battle simulations, although I stayed away from the card games like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Summoner/">Magic</a>.
I'll rant about that some other time.</p>
<p>My two favorite games were <a class="reference external" href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/474579/air-superiority-playable-jet-combat">Air Superiority</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.starfleetgames.com">Starfleet Battles</a>. As a
science fiction fan, I did like Star Trek, and like a lot of boys my favorite
parts were the ship to ship combat. SFB simulated that combat better than I'd
ever seen before, and even spun off a pretty cool <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwQ3rm0LcWU">video game</a> that spawned a
couple of sequels. I still have the first one.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>The tabletop game was as complex as any chess game, and a lot more fun in my
opinion, so it was with no small amount of nostalgia that I dusted off the
game for my 10-year-old son and I to look at a couple of months ago. To my
surprise, Jaan ate the game up, even if the rules sound like legalese and
combined weigh a few pounds. Now he can't get enough of the game, and I get to
play too, which is pretty cool, 'cause I don't have a lot of time for these
things anymore and I wasn't sure if anyone around Ottawa played it anyway.</p>
<p>I'm not really interested in all of the new material that ADB has released
since I was into the game, as I have plenty of material for it already, and
it'll take Jaan and I ages to get tired of it. The physics of the game are
broken and there are holes in the logic that I'll go into later, but it
suceeds in providing a fun gaming experience, and it's a hell of a lot more
fun than playing Monopoly or Clue, with all due respect to those games.</p>
<p>Lets be honest, in the end, boys don't grow up, our toys just get more
expensive.</p>

                <p>So I decided to dump Wordpress and go to something that I have more control
over. I was thinking of building my own static blogging system, but I looked
around and found that there are a few already. Being a fan of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> I
decided to try out <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.0/">Pelican</a>. It ...</p>
