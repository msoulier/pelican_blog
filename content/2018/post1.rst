Digging through my old work quotes, I realize just how much I love working with very odd people:

    <tim> I smell dead people

    <msoulier> look under your desk

    <tim> They're in the filing cabinet

or from another day:

    <tim> If anyone needs me, I'll be out back, mugging old ladies
    for their pension cheques

    <msoulier> ...but you did that yesterday...

    <chris> he said no, yesterday was the old men...

    <msoulier> ah, my mistake

I really miss that old private chat room of ours.
