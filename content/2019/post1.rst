I recently re-watched the movie Primer_, which is completely under-appreciated
IMHO, and this quote jumped out at me:

   What's worse? Thinking that you're paranoid or knowing that you should be?
      -- Aaron, Primer

AFAIK you can watch this movie free online. Just search for it. I might have
to buy a copy though, as I do really like this movie. It actually makes you
think and does not hold your hand, which is rare in movies today.
