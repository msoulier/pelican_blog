Wow, it's been a ridiculous amount of time since I posted anything. The fact is
that I've been busy in a lot of non-technical things, like my hobbies. One of
those hobbies is working to create, and use fountain pens.

Yeah, I know. Whatever. Fountain pens made me love writing again. Who knew that
my hatred of writing was mostly hatred of ballpoint pens and their lousy writing
experience?

I'll talk about my side-business on Etsy later (hint: it's http://32pens.ca),
but in addition to making pens I do like using store-bought pens, and if you're
looking to try a fountain pen for the first time, it's hard to go wrong with the
`Pilot Metropolitan`_.

Given that it's Pilot, it does use proprietary cartridges/converters, which is
annoying and unnecessary, but it's cheap, decent-looking and it's a great
writer. I got mine in a Fine nib, which I preferred when I started with Fountain
Pens. As it's a Japanese pen, their idea of fine is more like an extra-fine for
the rest of the planet, so these days I actually prefer a Japanese medium nib.

Now, I could order a new Metropolitan in medium, since Pilot doesn't sell parts
for their pens *ahem*, but it's cheaper to buy a whole new pen. Specifically,
the `Pilot Kakuno`_. The Metropolitan, you see, uses the same nibs as the
Kakuno, the Penmanship, the Prera, etc, and you can just swap them in. Mind you,
the Kakuno nibs have smiley faces on them, as they're intended for kids, so my
Metropolitan now has a smiley on it.

And, my Kakuno now has a fine nib, and is the only place that currently fits the
larger Pilot Con-70 converter in my collection. I'm not sure if I'll bother
keeping it, as I'm trying to thin-out the pens that I'm holding on to. In fact
I'm trying to thin out all of my belongings down to the essentials. Less is
more.

So, cheap source of nibs for your Metropolitan, being the Kakuno and the
Penmanship, if you can find them. Amazon is a good source for harder to find
models.

And now, my pens smiles at me. Weird, but oddly comforting.
