I've been curling for about 4 years now, and it's already taught me a lot
about life. I thought I'd share some of what it has taught me:

    * balance is very important
    * anything worthwhile requires hard work
    * you often can't brute force your way out of a problem
    * you must think before you act
    * you can often do much more with help from others
    * shouting at people doesn't actually make them work harder
    * hope for the best and plan for the worst
    * when you finally understand the conditions, they change
    * don't take anything too seriously

and finally

    * men can still look like men while holding a broom :)

Cheers
