Yeah, I really do. From my childhood I always prefered more intellectual
activities than active ones, reading, watching movies, tv. Growing up
asthmatic had something to do with that, but I overcame it later in life and
had no excuses anymore. Still, studies to do, computers to play with, digital
bad guys to beat up, and a lot of my activities involved sitting.

I played baseball as a kid, got into Tae kwon Do in my late teens, but as a
University student I couldn't afford the money to continue, and I moved a lot
for a while. I was never much of a runner, but for a while I was a damn good
cyclist because I didn't have a car and it was how I got around.

In recent years a back injury made it clear that I sit too much, and I've
tried various things to try to fix it, usually charging in too fast,
determined to conquer the problem and I ended up with another injury. I needed
to figure out how to go slower, targeting my problems and not doing too much,
but making progress.

Recently the wife that I don't deserve found Athlete365_ and Mr. John
Sokolowski. He looked at my flexibility and strength, or lack thereof, and has
put together an evolving program to help me fix them, at a speed that won't
set me back with another injury. He also gave me some tools to help with
muscles that keep me awake at night, ruining my sleep. He also thinks that I
should become a Yoga master. Heh...sure John. Maybe in 20 years of practice.
I'm right on that.

I've also been tweaking my diet, not that my diet was bad, but I recently
found out about some of the evils of excessive carbohydrates, from an amusing
documentary, `Fat Head`_, a response to "Supersize Me". Since reducing
bread (not hard, I have a gluten tolerance issue), rice and potatoes in my
diet, and exercising more, I've lost about ten pounds in the past couple of
months.

My issues aren't gone by any means, I have a lot of work to do, but guidance
helps. There's a difference between working hard and working smart.
Previously, I was just working hard.

If you've read this sitting down, get up and move around. Trust me.
