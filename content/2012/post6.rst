I've needed a new desktop for a while now. As I'm primarily a Unix user, I
typically buy a cheap PC and put Linux_ on it. This involves doing a bunch of
research into available hardware to make sure that everything is going to
work, like accelerated graphics for any games I'd like to play, supported
network drivers, etc. Over the years it's gotten easier and easier to get
Linux working on a box, but sometimes I still have to work to get something
working.

The end result is a working Linux workstation that I can use for work, and my
basic computing needs, often involving fighting with the fact that noone wants
to support it or any software that I'm using. That part does get old year
after year. 

For example, I bought a Kobo_ ages ago, and I had to use a Windows box to run
the Kobo desktop software, to patch its firmware and put books on it. Later I
found out that I could just copy .epub books into it like a flash drive, which
is awesome by the way Kobo, but you get the idea. For my iPod shuffle, I copy
mp3s onto it and run the rebuild_db Python script to update the db on the
iPod. There are workarounds for these issues, but sometimes it's nice to just
plug something in and have it work. And fighting with my devices isn't as much
fun as it used to be. I'm too damn busy.

So, based the recommendations of various friends and colleagues, I decided to
take the plunge with my new desktop, and try a `Mac Mini`_ from Apple_, running
`Mac OS X`_ 10.8, "Mountain Lion". I figured that it's a lot better supported
in commercial software land, while being `BSD Unix`_ underneath, so maybe it's
the best of both worlds.

I need to customize the crap out of it, and get used to the interface and
keybindings, and do a lot of reading. I hope to post my experiences here, so
stay tuned if you're interested.

Sure, I could have just thrown Linux on another box, and maybe I still will,
but I've *done* that. I felt like doing something new.
