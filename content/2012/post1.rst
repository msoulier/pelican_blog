So I decided to dump Wordpress and go to something that I have more control
over. I was thinking of building my own static blogging system, but I looked
around and found that there are a few already. Being a fan of Python_ I
decided to try out Pelican_. It uses a bunch of technology that I would use
anyway, like reStructuredText_, Jinja2_, etc.

It also gives me an excuse to play with Heroku_ for hosting.
