Back before I had any real responsibilities, I spent a lot of time playing
various games. I've probably played most of them. Roleplaying games, tabletop
battle simulations, although I stayed away from the card games like Magic_.
I'll rant about that some other time.

My two favorite games were `Air Superiority`_, and `Starfleet Battles`_. As a
science fiction fan, I did like Star Trek, and like a lot of boys my favorite
parts were the ship to ship combat. SFB simulated that combat better than I'd
ever seen before, and even spun off a pretty cool `video game`_ that spawned a
couple of sequels. I still have the first one.

The tabletop game was as complex as any chess game, and a lot more fun in my
opinion, so it was with no small amount of nostalgia that I dusted off the
game for my 10-year-old son and I to look at a couple of months ago. To my
surprise, Jaan ate the game up, even if the rules sound like legalese and
combined weigh a few pounds. Now he can't get enough of the game, and I get to
play too, which is pretty cool, 'cause I don't have a lot of time for these
things anymore and I wasn't sure if anyone around Ottawa played it anyway.

I'm not really interested in all of the new material that ADB has released
since I was into the game, as I have plenty of material for it already, and
it'll take Jaan and I ages to get tired of it. The physics of the game are
broken and there are holes in the logic that I'll go into later, but it
suceeds in providing a fun gaming experience, and it's a hell of a lot more
fun than playing Monopoly or Clue, with all due respect to those games.

Lets be honest, in the end, boys don't grow up, our toys just get more
expensive.
