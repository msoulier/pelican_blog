I am constantly amazed at the ignorance and outright laziness of Canadian
drivers. Yes, we could be worse, but we could also be much, much better.

Case in point, I see people constantly turning left, and swinging out into the
right lane, or turning right, and swinging out into the left lane.

The rules really are `not that hard`_ to understand, and given the
implications at an intersection with traffic coming from all directions, if
you violate the rules, you're a idiot. Either you're too dumb to remember the
rules, and can't figure out how, in this connected day and age, to look them
up, or you simply don't care about the rules. And given the rules are there to
not only keep me and my children alive, but also you, then yes, you're an
idiot.

Kinda like not bothering to signal. What, lever too far away? Can't be
bothered to be safe while sharing the road with me, and my two beautiful
children? Then you shouldn't be driving. Idiot.

I'm very tempted to drive with a dash cam at all times, and post the worst
offenders on youtube. Granted, we all have idiot moments, and sometimes it's
me, but it's the consistent idiots I'm interested in.
